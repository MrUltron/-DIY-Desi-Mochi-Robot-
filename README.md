# -DIY-Desi-Mochi-Robot-
Meet the Desi Mochi Robot by Jayabeer Sutar! A charming DIY companion with a unique, handcrafted copper wire body. Powered by an ESP32-C3, it responds to touch with animated expressions on its OLED face and cheerful buzzer sounds. A creative, low-cost take on interactive robotics inspired by the original Mochi.
# Desi Mochi Robot ü§ñ

A cute, interactive, and completely DIY companion robot made from a Xiao ESP32-C3 and a sculpted copper wire body. Mochi reacts to your touch with expressions and sounds!

!

This project is a perfect example of a low-cost, "Desi" (homegrown/DIY) approach to robotics, blending simple electronics with handmade artistry.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Touch:** Pat Mochi on its head (TP touch sensor) to see it react.
* **Expressive Face:** A 0.92" OLED screen serves as Mochi's face, showing different animations.
* **Sound Feedback:** A buzzer provides simple audio cues for interactions.
* **Handmade Body:** The unique body is crafted from copper wire, making each Mochi one-of-a-kind.
* **Rechargeable:** Powered by a 3.7V Li-ion battery with a TP4056 charging module.
